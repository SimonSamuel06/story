        <h1>Missing Body</h1>
        <p>
            In 2019 – On an Afternoon a huge Siren was heard in the city a body was
            taken to the ER everyone was in a huge shock hearing the persons unfortunate
            accident his family, friends and other close people rushed to the ER. He stayed
            in the ICU for four weeks until it was heard he was no more. The whole city had
            the same question how did this happen? The police Questioned
            his family, friends and other people who saw him that morning and his neighbors
            , and putting all the puzzle’s together , the day the accident happened he told
            his mother that he was going to his friends birthday and when his mother asked
            him “ Why so Early “ he told to surprise him it was around 10 to 10:30 that a
            lory that came from the opposite direction came and hit his Vehicle and his car
            rolled down the road while this was happening he was on a call with his friend
            who also planed to surprise there Best Friend. The police Questioned all of his
            very close friends but the police did not find any suspicion in them so the
            case was given to the Special Force when everyone
            thought it was no use the two Special Force officers did not give up on there
            mission after many try the court itself decided to bury the body the body was
            kept in the Mortuary but here was the biggest shock everyone got, his family
            decided his funeral but when they came to take his body it was already gone his
            family members called the officers and they started to investigate the first
            step was to check the CCTV Cameras but the day when they concluded the day that
            the body went missing the cameras weren’t working and the nurses haven’t gone
            into the mortuary because there was to many cases on that day and they where
            short in nurses that day so the officers knew this was done by one of the staff
            members of that hospital the officers Questioned
            all of the staff members and took all the details of the staffs which was off
            on that day but none of it helped but when they thought there hopes where gone again
            a doctor which was off that day told the officers on that same day an unknown
            call was there in his office so the nurse connected it to his number ,and the
            person who called clamed to be his Relative he asked him in which ward was the
            body kept and the doctor not suspecting anything odd said all the details to
            that man so the officers tracked down the number but it was already too late
            the suspect had already disconnected the number. The officers found the last
            time this number was used and the date was the day the officers thought the
            body went missing the number was last used on . They Questioned the people who
            was present on that day in the hospital but no one knew what happened but then
            one of his family members told the officers that they haven’t Questioned one of
            his very close friend who wasn’t participating to surprise there friend but
            when the officers call him he did not pick up his phone and that made the
            officers curies to know more about this friend it was revealed that he was his
            best friend and had been friends since childhood they both shared the same
            dream of making something big out of them but there wasn’t anything to suspect
            from him still no hope . The officers came to his residence but his parents
            were the only people there his parents told he was out for a business trip and
            that he did not tell them when he would come back but the officers just did not
            believe them . They preferred to check the house but his parent did not let
            them the officers took this to the court and the court allowed them to check
            the house they did not leave a small area and checked every where but they forgot
            to check the basement and when one of the officer came to check the basement it
            was locked with many locks and when then asked to open his parents said they
            forgot where the keys were but the officers broke the locks open to find The Missing Body and after two weeks his friend was
            found but still now the officers haven’t found why he killed his own friend
            still he won’t tell why…. . The court commanded that he would be behind bares
            and everyone who supported him.
